Parallelism should be frictionless, allowing every developer to start with the assumption of parallelism instead of being forced to take it up once performance demands it. Considerable progress has been made in achieving this vision on the language and training front; it has been demonstrated that sophomores can learn basic data structures and algorithms in a "parallel first" model enabled by a high-level parallel language. However, achieving both high productivity and high performance on current and future heterogeneous systems requires innovation throughout the hardware/software stack. This project brings two distinct perspectives to this problem: the "theory down" approach, focusing on high-level parallel languages and the theory and practice of achieving provable performance bounds within them; and the "architecture up" approach, focusing on rethinking abstractions at the architectural, operating system, runtime, and compiler levels to optimize raw performance.   Constellation has roots partially in the [Interweaving Project](https://interweaving.org).
